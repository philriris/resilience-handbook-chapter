## Electronic Supplementary Information for "The biogeography of population resilience in lowland South America" chapter

This repository holds the code and data for reproducing the results of the analysis in the title chapter, forthcoming in the _Oxford Handbook of Resilience in Climate History_. It also contains supplementary information on the statistical modelling undertaken as part of the aforementioned work. 

The code comprises five principal sections, plus setup:

0. Setup & data loading
1. Data processing and display
2. Radiocarbon analysis
3. Statistical modelling
4. Output
5. Supplementary output

The code features an extended version of the [p2pPerm function](https://github.com/philriris/p2pPerm) that was first introduced in [Riris and De Souza (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.740629). 

In addition, the code is accompanied by three datasets:

- A table containing archaeological radiocarbon dates from lowland tropical South America
- A shapefile of South American ecoregions, available [here](http://ecologicalregions.info/data/sa/)
- A table of domesticated Neotropical plants resolved in Amazonian palaeoecological records, after [Iriarte et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2020.106582)
